## Levitation Controller Design of a 5-DOF Magnetic Rotor-Bearing System using Sliding Mode Control

Design levitation controller for a 5-DOF Magnetic Rotor-Bearing System :
- Utilize Sliding Mode Control (SMC) 
- Simulate the system
- Address steady state errors (using Integral Sliding Mode Control, ISMC) 

Magnetic Rotor-Bearing System:
- Utilizes radial and axial active magnetic bearings (radial AMB, axial AMB).
- Designed for stable rotor levitation.

Radial AMB Configuration:
- 8-pole heteropolar AMB with differential driving.
- Windings generate magnetic force in X and Y directions.
- Even distribution of rotor weight on X and Y axes.

Coordinate Systems:
- Focus on radial motion with four degrees of freedom.
- Body coordinate (rotational and translational motions).
- Sensor coordinate (rotor position from sensing planes).

Control Design Approach:
Combine backstepping and sliding mode control for amplifier dynamics but :
Derivation of control law with Backstepping is very complex.

Sliding Manifold:
Chosen to define the desired dynamics.
Designed to be compatible with the slowest amplifier response.

Initial assumption: Rotor does not rotate to simplify control design (Î©=0).

Switching Control Gain:
Tuned to overcome uncertainty introduced by amplifier dynamics.
